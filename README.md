### Coin Chase

Hello Herr Leissler, here is my game, it is called Coin Chase.

## INSTRUCTIONS

There are 5 levels. The objective is to run around and collect all of the coins and a door will open for you to go to the next level. There are also monsters patrolling the levels and if they see you they will chase you. And when they get close to you they will swing their sword at you and you will have to start the level again.
If you fall off the edge you will start again.

To move use the arrow keys.

Viel Spaß!
